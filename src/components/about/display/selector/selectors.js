                                Born in 1993, I'm a {age('08/13/1993')} years old Engineer from Argentina.
                                In 2018, I graduated from the <a href='https://www.fi.mdp.edu.ar/' target='_blank'>University of Mar del Plata </a> 
                                with an Engineering Degree in Electronics, which is equivalent to a Bachelors + Master degree.
                                Also, I had the opportunity to be an exchange student at <a href="https://vt.edu/" target='_blank'>Virginia Tech</a> (U.S)
                                 with a Fulbright Scholarship.
